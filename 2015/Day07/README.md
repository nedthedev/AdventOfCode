# 2015 - Day 07

## Part One
For this one, I ended up just have a single function, although I'm not a fan of that. All in all the code quality for this one is pretty mediocre, it works, but it's a bit of a mess. I think to make it more readable, maintainable, I'd add more variables, or perhaps an array of variables and pass them to a separate function to check for whether or not a wire's inputs are all powered.

## Part Two
Used all the same logic as part one, but simply changed the input for a particular wire and then the output changed for the rest of the circut board.
